Hi! This is a repo for my Linux Admin (CNG 2002 - Unix/Linux Server Admin) class featuring "Hello World!" in five different languages. In this assignment, I must pull from this repo in a Docker Container and run the files again.

BASH:
./bash.sh
C:
gcc see.c -o output
./output
PYTHON:
python3 python.py
GO:
go run go.go
JAVA:
java Hello_World
